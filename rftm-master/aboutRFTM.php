            <h3>About RFTM</h3>
            In January 2019, a friend gave me the to start a Roger Federer fanpage to compete with his Novak Djokovic one. The same evening I created the account @rogerfedererthemaster where I posted some pictures I found on the internet. The beginning was difficult, the account was not very successful... One year later, my account had a little more than 5000 followers. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic which pushed many of us to spend more time on our phones/computers. That is when this account grew by leaps and bounds. In addition, I started posting "reels" of Roger's best points. By the end of 2020, more than 40,000 people around the world were following to my fanpage.<br>
            </br>Today, my account has 80,000 subscribers, all of them more fan of Roger than the others. And this number is growing every day. Severin Luthi is also a subscriber.
